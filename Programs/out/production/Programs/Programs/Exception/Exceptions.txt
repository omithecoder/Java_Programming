Multiple Types of Error in the Same Program
1) Compile-time error
2) Run-time error
3) Logic error

Q: Compile-time error
A: - Syntax error
- Type error
- Declaration error
- etc.

Q: Run-time error
A: - Division by zero
- Array index out of bounds
- etc.

Q: Logic error
A: - Program does not do what it is supposed to do
- Program does not do what the programmer intended it to do

Here Compile-time error are most easy to find and fix
& sometime Logical error are most easy to find but sometime they are most difficult to find and fix

But Run-time error are most difficult to find and fix

because above 2 errors can be detected by testers for a specific application and this error occurs due to
some faulty or incorrect code written by the programmer (It is a Programmer Fault)

But Run-time error are most difficult to find and fix because they are not detected by testers for a specific application and this error occurs due to
some faulty or not excepted input given by the user (It is a User Fault)

for example, if we are writing a program to divide two numbers and if the user gives the second number as 0 then it will give a run-time error

So in exception handling, we can handle these types of errors means Run-time errors


Here in every code we are writing some Normal as well as Critical Statements
for example
- Normal Statement: print("Hello") here it will print Hello 100%
- Critical Statement: db.connect() here if db is present then connect else it will give an error

So in exception handling, we can handle these types of errors means Critical Statements
